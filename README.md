## Usage in jbrowse-web

Add to the "plugins" of your JBrowse Web config. The unpkg CDN should be stable, or you can download the js file to your server

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "GWAS",
      "url": "https://unpkg.com/jbrowse-plugin-gwas/dist/jbrowse-plugin-gwas.umd.production.min.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plugin is currently quite basic, and there is no mouseover interactivity or drawn labels on features
